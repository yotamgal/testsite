    <h1>Rabbis: Fascinating Creatures</h1>
    <p>A rabbi is a Jewish religious leader and teacher who is trained in Jewish law, tradition, and ethics. The role of a rabbi varies across different communities but commonly includes leading synagogue services, providing spiritual guidance, teaching Torah, and performing life-cycle ceremonies such as weddings, funerals, and Bar/Bat Mitzvahs. Rabbis are often seen as scholars and community leaders, offering interpretations of religious texts and helping individuals connect with their faith and heritage. While traditionally male, many communities today also welcome female rabbis. The word “rabbi” comes from Hebrew, meaning “my teacher” or “my master.”</p>
